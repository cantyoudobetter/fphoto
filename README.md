Photos4Me.Net Help Page
Welcome to Photos4Me.Net - a new way to easily share photos with friends and family. Photos4Me was developed out of the need for me to be able to let my wife help me keep our family web site up to date.  Basic thumbnailing and html layout was tiresome for me and more tedious and technical than my wife cared to deal with.  Also, my sister wanted me to set her up a site. Therefore, I decided to create a site that let anyone set up a photo site easily and then be able to view photos from many friends and family in one easy to use web interface with no tools required, except a way to make digital photos(i.e. camera or scanner) and a browser connection.

How to set up a site
If you plan to create your own site you will most likely need to go through two steps:
1. Set up your site and create a site admin account (45 seconds).
2. Set up a second account for viewing yours and other people's sites (35 seconds).

To set up a new site, from the login page click the "Create New Site" link. You will be asked for a Site name, a secret question, and a secret answer. The secret is important, because it is how other people will gain access to your site when they set up their viewing accounts. You can make it easy if you do not care who sees your site, or you can make it something completely obscure.

Next you will put in your name, username, and password. There is not a way to change these three values later, so choose them carefully now.

That is it! You now have your very own photo site. Login with your admin username and password that you just created and you will be able to see the site information. Now is your chance to update the message of the day. The message of the day is text that will scroll on the top right of the screen when people are looking at your site. You can use it to relay important news, or just tell a joke.

If you click the "Photo Maint" tab you will be able to start adding pictures. First you must create sections. Sections are like folders to hold pictures. For instance if you have a birthday, you may want to create a birthday folder.

Once you create the folder, click on it to start uploading pictures. Click the browse button to find a picture on your hard drive. The picture must be a JPEG right now. In the future, I will add support for bitmaps and GIFs. When you are ready to upload it, click the add button. The system will creat a thumbnail for you. At this point you can rotate or delete the image by clicking the links next to it. Keep adding pictures until your section is done.


How to view other people's sites
Whether or not you have a site of your own, you will need to set up a viewer login. From the login page, click the "New User" tab. You will then select the site you want to view. Do not worry if you want to view more than one site... You can add others later. After you click next you have to answer that site's secret question. Do not ask me the answer... I do not even know (they are encrypted in the database). Ask the site's owner if you do not know the answer. Next you have to put in your name, username, and password. Select your username and password wisely as they cannot be changed yet.

Now you can log in with your new password. After you log in you will see the photo viewer. You can select from different sections on the left. You can see the enlarged photos by clicking on them. You can add comments to any photos. Please keep comments brief and funny.

You can add other people's sites to yours by clicking the "Add/Remove Site" tab from the main photo page.

FAQ- Frequently Asked Questions
1. Should I put my kid's photo's on this site?
Well, I did.  I built this using a state of the art application server and database running under Linux.  The environment in inherently secure.  However, nothing is completely secure.  If you plan to put photos on the net, I suggest you do it here.  I promise I will not do anything with them, and NOBODY else has physical or digital access to this server except me. To maximize your security, select the 128 Bit Secure Access link on the login page. This will encrypt all activity between you and the server, but may slow down performance.  The best thing you can do is select a secret question that only people that you want on the site will know.
3.  So who can use it?
Anyone...  All I ask is NO PORNOGRAPHY!
2. How much does it cost
Nothing...  Zilch... Zip... Nada...  I want to offer a place for people to do this kind of thing and use the internet to share their lives in a safe and fun way.
3. Why did you do it?
Because I got sick of administring my old photo site and wanted to see what my friends have been up to.
4.  Can I contribute to development
Please!  I am licensing this under GPL right now, so just email me and I will send you the source and the database and you can help out.  I also do not care if you want to set up your own instance of the system on your server.  I will help you through the install if you need it.
